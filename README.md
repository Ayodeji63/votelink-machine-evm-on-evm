# VoteLink - Secure Offline & Blockchain-Based Voting System

VoteLink is a hybrid voting platform designed for regions with limited internet connectivity. It combines **offline vote collection**, **IPFS for decentralized data storage**, and a **blockchain smart contract** for transparent and tamper-proof vote validation and result tallying.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

In many parts of Africa and other developing regions, elections are plagued by manipulation, insecurity, and limited digital infrastructure. Voter privacy is often compromised, and results are difficult to verify independently. VoteLink solves this by:

- Allowing secure voting in **offline environments**
- Enabling **vote integrity via blockchain**
- Ensuring **voter privacy** through a commit-reveal scheme
- Providing a **public vote explorer** for transparent result viewing

## ✅ Features

- ✨ Offline vote capture with Raspberry Pi and biometric authentication
- 🔐 Commit-Reveal Voting Scheme for end-to-end privacy
- 🧠 Votes stored on IPFS before sync
- 🔗 Blockchain smart contract handles reveal and tallying
- 🧾 QR Code printout after voting, linking to public explorer
- 🔍 Web-based vote explorer: `https://votelinkexplorer.com/{voteHash}`

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Python** (Kivy for GUI)
- **IPFS** for distributed storage
- **Solidity** for smart contracts
- **Raspberry Pi OS**
- **Adafruit Fingerprint Sensor**
- **Web3.py**
- **QR Code Generator**
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** for the vote explorer

## 🧪 Performance Considerations

- Works on low-power Raspberry Pi (Model 3/4)
- Requires no internet to vote
- IPFS upload is deferred until device regains connection
- Only admins interact with blockchain (for commit and reveal)
- System designed with minimal compute and storage requirements

## 🔐 Privacy by Design

- **No wallet needed for voters**
- Voter ID is never directly stored on-chain
- Salt + candidate ID are hashed for commit phase
- VoteHash printed as QR code for anonymous verification

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Setup on Raspberry Pi
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip ipfs
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
ipfs init
ipfs daemon
````

### 2. Start Kivy App

```bash
python3 main.py
```

### 3. Admin Sync (Online)

- Upload IPFS vote files
- Commit vote hash to smart contract
- Reveal votes after election ends

## 🌐 Smart Contract

The smart contract:

- Accepts vote hashes during the commit phase
- Validates candidate ID during reveal phase
- Tally results securely and transparently

See [`contracts/VoteLink.sol`](./contracts/VoteLink.sol) for full code.

## 📈 Future Plans

- Integrate **ZK proofs** for more private reveals
- Deploy **MACI (Minimal Anti-Collusion Infrastructure)** for full anonymity (was explored in earlier web version)
- Add **tamper detection** via camera module
- Extend explorer to visualize IPFS logs forensics
